As part of my [ DataCamp ](https://www.datacamp.com/profile/andreigegliuk) program for becoming a data scientist, I worked on a project using Pandas for data analysis. 
I learned the fundamental concepts and techniques for working with data in Python, including how to clean, prepare, and manipulate data using Pandas.

In addition to these skills, I also had the opportunity to apply my knowledge by working on a real-world project analyzing the repository data of the Scala programming language. 
This project allowed me to uncover insights about Scala's development history and contributors, including who has had the most influence and who are the experts in the language. 
By utilizing both version control system (Git) and project hosting site (GitHub) data, and creating visualizations, I was able to showcase my findings and deepen my understanding of data analysis.

Overall, this project has been a valuable part of my journey to becoming a data scientist and has provided me with a solid foundation in using Pandas for data analysis, as well as hands-on experience in analyzing open source project repository data.
